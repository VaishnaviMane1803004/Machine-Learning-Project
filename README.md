Rain sustains life by providing the means for transferring water from the atmosphere to the surface, and it is extremely important for us to measure and predict local and global rainfall behavior to better undestand the water cycle.
Machine Learning algorithms are mostly useful in predicting rainfall. Some of the major Machine Learning algorithms are ARIMA Model(Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average), Artificial Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Self Organizing Map.The first models are ARIMA Model.
Rainfall Prediction is the application of science and technology to predict the amount of rainfall over a region. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity and pre-planning of water structures.
