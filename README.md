Rain sustains life by providing the means for transferring water from the atmosphere to the surface.It is important for us to measure and predict local and global rainfall behavior to better undestand the water cycle and also to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity and pre-planning of water structures. Rainfall Prediction is the application of science and technology to predict the amount of rainfall over a region.Machine Learning algorithms are mostly useful in predicting rainfall. Some of the major Machine Learning algorithms are Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor , Support Vector Regression , Ridge and Lasso.
